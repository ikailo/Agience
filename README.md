# Agience: AI Agents Powered by You

**Agience** is an **open-source** intelligent agent platform that enables anyone to easily **build**, **deploy**, and **manage** intelligent agents capable of automating tasks, processing complex information, and facilitating communication between devices and systems with scalability and reliability.

## Highlights

- **Distributed Architecture**: Agience hosts can be deployed anywhere, ensuring data residency compliance for applications across personal, business, industrial, and enterprise levels of any size and scope.

- **Modular Agents**: Scalable, autonomous agents encapsulate their functions and data with the flexibility to move seamlessly between hosts.

- **Agent Agnostic**: Agience is designed to support any type of agent, with initial compatibility for Semantic Kernel and plans to expand to all agent frameworks.

- **Open-Source**: Released under the AGPL-3.0 license, Agience allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute the software. Build anything using Agience, with modifications to the framework shared for the collective benefit.

## Architecture

Agience is a distributed intelligent agent platform consisting of a network of authorities that provide essential services to their respective communities. These services include identity management, message brokering, streaming, databases, and management APIs, all supporting secure, coordinated interactions across a network of hosts, agents, and topics, each governed by its respective authority.

A host, deployed on devices or systems, offers computational resources and manages the flow of information between agents and topics under the guidance of its authority. Agents, acting as digital representatives of individuals, perform tasks and exchange information through topics while respecting the boundaries established by their authority.

Each authority governs the permissions and interactions of its agents, hosts, and topics, with JWT-based authorization managed by an identity provider (IDP). Authorities can establish trusted relationships, allowing agents from different authorities to interact across boundaries when authorized. This structure ensures that agents operate securely within defined scopes and adhere to permissions across the Agience ecosystem.
